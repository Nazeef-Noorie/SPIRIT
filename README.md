# **SPIRIT**

SPIRIT (Sparse Preconditioned Iterative Refinement & Iterative Techniques) is a custom-built sparse linear solver designed for efficiently solving large, non-symmetric, and time-evolving systems arising in scientific simulations. Developed with integration into the SkyNet nucleosynthesis code in mind, SPIRIT combines classical numerical techniques with modern design choices tailored for high-performance computing environments.

**Motivation**
In simulations of explosive nucleosynthesis—such as those occurring in neutron star mergers or core-collapse supernovae—the need to solve large, sparse systems of equations at every time step poses a significant computational bottleneck. Existing solvers often rely on dense matrix operations, are commercially licensed, or lack the flexibility required for high-precision astrophysical simulations.

SPIRIT was developed to address this gap: a fully open-source, physics-aware solver that leverages the sparsity, structure, and recurring patterns of Jacobians generated in such simulations. It not only achieves high accuracy and speed but also maintains transparency and adaptability for further development and research.


**Key Features:**

  a) Novel and minimal memory preconditioning using filtered ILU(0) followed by unique ILUT to improve convergence rates
   
  b) Iterative refinement for high-precision residual correction
   
  c) BiCGSTAB solver with preconditioning for robust performance on non-symmetric systems
   
  d) CSR-based architecture optimised for sparse matrix operations
   
  e) Highly modular and lightweight—easily adaptable for other scientific computing needs

**Use**

The current version of SPIRIT code requires input in the form of a text file where each system of linear equations is represented in a specific structure. Each system \( AX = B \) is delineated over four lines: 

1. The **first line** contains the row pointers.
2. The **second line** has the column indices.
3. The **third line** consists of the non-zero values of matrix \( A \).
4. The **fourth line** includes the values of the right-hand side vector \( B \).

This means every four consecutive lines in the file represent a new problem to be solved.

I have a data file prepared with six matrices that were generated by the SkyNet code during a run of r-process simulations. While the SPIRIT solver has been validated for extensive sets of matrices produced by SkyNet, I opted to work with a smaller selection in this case due to the considerable memory requirements of the matrices involved. 


**Applications**

Although developed in the context of explosive nucleosynthesis simulations, SPIRIT is broadly applicable to other domains requiring fast, accurate solutions to sparse linear systems, including: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Structural mechanics and finite element simulations, Large-scale biological network modelling, Geophysical inversion problems and Quantitative finance and large matrix analytics.
